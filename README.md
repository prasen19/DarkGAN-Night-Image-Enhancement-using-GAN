# Night-Image-Enhancement-using-Generative Adversarial Network

Low light image enhancement is one of the challenging tasks in computer vision, and
it becomes more difficult when images are very dark. Recently, most of low light image
enhancement work is done either on synthetic data or on the images which considerably
visible. We propose a new method to enhance real-world night-time images, which are
dark and noisy. The proposed method consists of two pairs of Generator - Discriminator.
Moreover, the proposed method enhances dark shades and removes noise up to a much
extent, with natural-looking colors in the output image. Experimental results evaluation
of the proposed method on the ”See In the Dark dataset” demonstrates the effectiveness of
the proposed model compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method
yields comparable better results on qualitative and quantitative assessments when compared
with the existing methods.

The following image shows some results of our method on See In The Dark Dataset.

The image below shows effectiveness of our method on images captured by mobile phone in our institute's campus.
